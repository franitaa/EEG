# EEG-Cognitive-States

The main goal of this project is to analyze electroenecephalography (EEG) signals in order to separate different cognitive states and characterize them according to the brain rhythms present.
To achieve this, several signal processing techiniques are applied. Different filters are used to remove line and drift noises, and artifacts caused by ocular movements. The results are then analyzed through spectrograms.
